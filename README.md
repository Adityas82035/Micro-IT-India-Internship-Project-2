Currency Converter is a responsive and user-friendly web application that allows users to convert any amount between multiple international currencies using real-time exchange rates.
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app integrates with the Open Exchange Rate API to fetch up-to-date conversion data.
âœ¨ Features:
- Live exchange rate conversion
- Supports over 160 global currencies
- Smooth transitions and modern UI
- Fully responsive and accessible design
This project helped me strengthen my skills in API integration, DOM manipulation, and front-end development.
